In this project, I used Python to wrangle and analyse several csudatasets for Instacart. I then created a report with visualisations displaying my process and my results and recommendations to key business questions from Instacart.

# Instacart Data Analysis Project

## Objective
In this project, I explored sales patterns with customer behaviours. The goal was to uncover insights that will inform better customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies for the sales and marketing teams. 

## Context
Instacart, an established online grocery platform, seeks to refine its marketing efforts. They believe that a one-size-fits-all approach isn't optimal. My analysis aims to segment customers effectively and propose targeted strategies to enhance product sales.

## Key Questions
- What are the peak order times and days?
- When do customers tend to spend the most?
- How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies?
- Which product departments are most popular?
- How do customer demographics and behaviors vary in terms of brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns?

## Data Source
The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets*. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions. 
*The customer dataset and column 'prices' were added to the original data set for learning purposes of the Career Foundry course.

## Tools used
The data was analszed using Python and the following libraries:
● Pandas: for data analysis
● Numpy: for mathematical equations
● Seaborn: for data visualizations
● Matplotlib: for data visualizations
● SciPy: for mathematical equations

## Stakeholders
The insights derived from this analysis will cater to:
- The Vice President of Marketing
- The Senior Vice President of Sales
- Instacart Customers

The goal is to align marketing strategies with customer preferences and uncover growth opportunities within Instacart's offerings.
